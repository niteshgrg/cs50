1.  GIF

2.  lossy compression is done when complete exact restoration is not required so compression rate could be achieved high and image can be of small size while lossless compression is done
    when we need exact restoration of data as it was before compressed upon uncompressing so compresion ratio is lower.

3.  JPEG

4.  The system overwrites the file first character to signal that file has been deleted and and moves the memory custers t file to free memory list maintained in OS so that it can be
    overwritten.

5.  Overwrite with garbage data.

6.  It's a header file for library which contains fixed length integers those lengths remain fixed under different OS environment.

7.  These are used to define fixed size(no. of bits) int's used to specify a particular field like in file header size is represented in 32 bits(4 bytes) and as size cannot be negative
    Hence, unit_32 is used.

8.  BYTE - 1 byte
    DWORD - 4 byte
    LONG - 4 byte
    WORD - 2 byte

9.  ASCII - BM
    Hexadecimal - 42
    Decimal - 01000010

10. bfSize tells us the size of entire bmp file while bisize tells us size of infoheader from where it started(bisize is fixed to be 40 bytes). 

11. biHeight negative means that image is top-down image with start at upper left corner and headers at top.

12. biBitCount

13. If there is no memory left to create a new file then fopen couldreturn NULL.

14. Third argument of fread is always 1 as we never want to exceed the length of struct.

15. 3

16. fseek() sets the file position of stream to the offset mentioned.

17. SEEK_CUR is a constant which represent current position of file stream.
